####Github collaborative workflow####

** Your part of the project **
1) create a *branch* from the *Master*, and create a *local mirror* of the *branch*
2) work on your *locar mirror* and sync it to your *branch*
3) when you are happy with your work and wish to bring it to the *master*, create a pull request
4) review and fix conflicts and merge
5) close the branch or merge the *master* to your *local mirror* of the branch (to keep the *local mirror* up to date)
