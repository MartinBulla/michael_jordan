### Github collaborative workflow ###

#### Your part of the project ####
1. create *your branch* from the *Master*, and create a *local mirror* of *your branch*
2. work on your *locar mirror* and sync it to *your branch*
3. when you are happy with your work and wish to bring it to the *master*, create a pull request
4. review and fix conflicts and merge
5. close *your branch* or merge the *master* to your *local mirror* and push to *your branch* (to keep the *local mirror* and thenn *your branch* up to date)
